abstract="IT helpdesks are charged with the task of responding quickly to user queries. To give the user confidence that their query matters, the helpdesk will auto-reply to the user with confirmation that their query has been received and logged. This auto-reply may include generic `boiler-plate' text that addresses common problems of the day, with relevant information and links. The approach explored here is to tailor the content of the auto-reply to the user's problem, so as to increase the relevance of the information included. Problem classification is achieved by training a neural network on a suitable corpus of IT helpdesk email data. While this is no substitute for follow-up by helpdesk agents, the aim is that this system will provide a practical stop-gap.",
