See thesis (document) and a short video presentation below.\nAbstract: The forecasting of large and rapid changes in wind power output known as ramp events is crucial for the incorporation of large volumes of wind energy into national electricity grids. Large variations in wind power supply must be compensated by ancillary energy sources which can include fossil fuels along with their associated costs and carbon emissions. Improved prediction of wind power will help to improve the competitiveness of wind energy against non-renewable energy sources, enable the global transition to cleaner fuels and facilitate climate change mitigation. This paper investigates the potential application of Machine Learning methodologies to the task of ramp event prediction. Using a non-binary wavelet transform approach to ramp characterisation, the ability of three Machine Learning models to predict ramp events in the Engie La Haute Borne wind farm dataset is compared. Results indicate that Recurrent Neural Network models show the greatest potential for ramp event forecasting.\nüëâ Conference details\nüìö Thesis Preview\nüìö Watch a brief summary of Sharp‚Äôs work: Interested?

Currently, in developing countries like Egypt, farmers‚Äô access to such information is extremely limited due to the agriculture support being either not available, inconsistent, or unreliable. The presented Cloud-based Complaints Management and Decision Support System for Sustainable Farming in Egypt, named as AgroSupportAnalytics, aims to resolve the problem of both the lack of support and advice for farmers, and the inconsistencies in doing so by current manual approach provided by agricultural experts. Key contribution is the development of an automated complaint management and decision support strategy, on the basis of extensive research on requirement analysis tailored for Egypt. The solution is grounded on the application of knowledge discovery and analysis on agricultural data and farmers‚Äô complaints, deployed on a Cloud platform, to provide farming stakeholders in Egypt with timely and suitable support. This paper presents the overall system architectural framework along with the information and storage services, which have been based on the requirements specifications phases of the project along with the historical data sets of past 10 year of farmers complaints and enquiries in Egypt.","tags":null,"title":"AgroSupportAnalytics- A Cloud-based Complaints Management and Decision Support System for Sustainable Farming in Egypt","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"[internal] VC Inter-dicsiplinary Research Fund UK ¬£25k to explore the design of the new class of ‚Äòintelligent assistants‚Äô that are appearing in commercial and domestic markets.
