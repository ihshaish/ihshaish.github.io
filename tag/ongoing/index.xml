      <description>&lt;p&gt;Innovate UK £1.2M funding to explore the application of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning for Infrastructure Project Performance Benchmarking — &lt;strong&gt;Co-PI leading the AI and ML team and development&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Research shows us that up to half of the money invested in infrastructure delivery could be spent more efficiently. Determined to increase the productivity and value-for-money of transport infrastructure projects, a transformative collaboration of 25 partners together with Government, i3P and the Construction Innovation Hub formed TIES Living Lab.
Using data, technology and Modern Methods of Construction (MMC) within live transport infrastructure projects, the TIES Living Lab will deliver significant value-adding benefits across the transport infrastructure sector.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Results of our first models to automate project benchmarking are provided in &lt;a href=&#34;https://ihshaish.github.io/publication/icms-preprint/&#34;&gt;our preprint&lt;/a&gt;. Models have been trained and systematically evaluated from a dataset of more than 50 thousand descriptions of items retrieved from 24 large infrastructure construction (Highways England) projects across the United Kingdom.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PETER MAYHEW&lt;/strong&gt; (funded by GE AVIATION) works on &amp;ldquo;a new framework to identify a common multilevel structure (event inter-dependency) of maintenance repairs to allow the prediction of the repair outcome of electronic components in avionics. Peter is developing a new framework, MARCONI (eMbeddings frAmework foR Classification Of avioNic repaIrs) based on Word2Vec for a word embedding to model the semantics in language sequence and events recorded in the maintenance records.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RYAN FELLOWS&lt;/strong&gt; (funded by ITS and CATE) works on conversational agents; the Task-oriented Dialogue Systems or chatobs in particular. His research focuses on  examining and evaluating the sensitivity of TODS (task-oriented dialogue systems / chatbots) performance to conversational quality attributes, and exploring methods to steer their performance on the basis of optimising attributes’ temporal variability in dialogue.&lt;/p&gt;
